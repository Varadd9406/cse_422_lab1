# Module Design

Inside the single/lab.c file, we declared two global static unsigned long variables (log_sec, log_nsec). 
We then used these two lines: 
```module_param(log_sec, ulong, 0)```
```module_param(log_nsec, ulong, 0)```
To define the two ulong module parameters.
We used the 0 permission bit in module_param to hide the module parameters from sysfs.

# Timer Design and Evaluation

We first created a static method call "timer_callback" that returns in type enum hrtimer_restart for the timer's expiration. 
Inside the init functon, we called hrtimer_init, and we used "my_hrtimer.function = &timer_callback;" to have the module's timer variable point to the timer expiration function. Lastly, we used "hrtimer_start(&my_hrtimer, interval, HRTIMER_MODE_REL);" to call hrtimer_start
Inside the exit function, we called "hrtimer_cancel(&my_hrtimer);" to cancel the module's timer.

Part of the system log: 
```

Feb 23 15:53:13 peterrpi kernel: [102016.018389] Log - timer callback function
```
As we can see, there's log of thread waking up approximately every 0.1 seconds, which is really close to what we expect it to perform. (off by at most 0.0001 escond)

# Thread Design and Evaluation

Inside the thread function, we have a printk call that logs the iteration, voluntary and involuntary cs. Right after that, we have ```set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE)``` and calls ```schedule()```. We have a while loop wrapped around these to check if there's ```kthread_should_stop``` flag being true.

1) The time interval varies approximately up to 0.001 seconds using 1 second intervals, and the time intervals varies approximately up to 0.000001 seconds using 1 millisecond intervals. Proportionately, the one with 1 second intervals varies more drastically. 
2) TODO

# Multi-threading Design and Evaluation

The set up is similar to that of a single thread monitor, except that inside ```timer_callback``` and ```ModuleInit``` function we wake up/call all four threads

1) The difference in the actual timestamp is more close to the actual intended interval in the multithread case than the single thread case.
2)
